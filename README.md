# Analysing-Mental-Health-during-COVID

# Introduction
Nowadays Social Media is a place where millions of peoples share their lives every day, creating a platform of self-expression and interesting information. Studies have reported that individuals living with a range of mental disorders, including depression, psychotic disorders, or other severe mental illnesses, use social media platforms at comparable rates as the general population, with use ranging from about 70% among middle-age and older individuals to upwards of 97% among younger individuals.

# Statement of the Problem:
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is “a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community”. According to an estimate by the WHO, mental illness makes about 15% of the total disease conditions around the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations.By now 38,364,519 people have been affected worldwide.Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind we thought of analysing the effect of COVID-19 on people's mental heath.
