# Analysing-Mental-Health-during-COVID

Statement of the Problem:
Due to social isolation and lockdowns, COVID-19 has affected the mental health of individuals too. As there are a lot of users in social media, we can use tweets to detect their mental health status. The first step in solving any problem is analysing the severity of the issue and finding the cause. Our project will be very helpful in this case.
